# Google Keep Clone

A simple note-taking application built with React that mimics the functionality of Google Keep. This application allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage notes with titles and content. Notes can be either simple text or lists with checkboxes. Users can also reorder the notes via drag and drop.


## Features

- Display a list of notes. Each note should have a title and content.
- Content can be either simple text or a list with checkboxes.
- Allow users to complete tasks from the list by clicking on the checkbox.
